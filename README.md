# Thoughts

My focus lied on demonstrating you my programming skills by adding functionality
rather than having a neat design or a better decision tree.

I hope I can impress with what I wrote, especially with the Theme toggler and the
ability to see & go back to previous answers in real time.

Things I would like to add in the future:

- Tests (I think with an app that size, the time to value ratio isn't worth it)
- Responsive design (No big skills needed here, just some more time)
- Having a "Purchase" option next to the restart button,
  which will open a popup with details of the recommended ticket
  (again, no big skills needed here, just some more time)

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any question regarding my code,
or would like me to add more features to it, to demonstrate my experience even further.

I hope you will enjoy reading the code even half as much as I enjoyed writing it!
